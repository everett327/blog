Sleeping late and waking up late, being on social media for an ungodly  number of hours, playing video games, watching Netflix and YouTube,  never exercising, and having low motivation. After years of doing the  same thing, every time I wake up, I feel like it’s just another boring  day.</p>\n<p>I saw a lot of tweets from people around my age saying they are bored.  Their life is boring and I thought it was normal and it’s a part of  growing up. Dumb me. One of the reasons I stay away from Twitter is they can unconsciously influence your thinking. If it’s a good one, that’s  great but from my experience, the bad outweighs the good.</p>\n<p>After watching a video from Hamza last night (link at the end of this post), I finally know why my life is boring and why I feel sooo weak a failure,  and pathetic. Sometimes depressed. You must have felt like that too, I  know.</p>\n<p>It’s actually because of the things I did like social media, Netflix, porn,  video games, and so on. My life is boring because it’s full of the “fun  and entertainment” stuff that normal people do.</p>\n<p>The reason for that is because they are instant gratification activities.  It’s instant, easy and comfortable. You don’t have to use your  brainpower too much and there is no resistance for you to have “fun”.  They say <strong>comfort kills a man</strong>, it’s true. It kills your happiness and fulfillment in the long run.</p>\n<p>The more nonsense and unbeneficial content you pay attention to,</p>\n<blockquote><span class=\"custom-blockquote-svg\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" data-reactroot=\"\">\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M22 12C22 6.5 17.5 2 12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12C2 17.5 6.5 22 12 22C13.8 22 15.5 21.5 17 20.6L22 22L20.7 17C21.5 15.5 22 13.8 22 12Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M17 8.5C15.23 8.97 14.07 10.84 14.01 13.27C14 13.33 14 13.4 14 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M9 8.5C7.23 8.97 6.07 10.84 6.01 13.27C6 13.33 6 13.4 6 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n</svg>\n</span><p>the more Netflix you watch, the more video games you play, the more junk food you eat, the more porn you indulge, the more weed you smoke, the  more your life gets boring and miserable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>These activities only give you the “happiness”, “fun” and “enjoyment” only  when you are locked in it.

You are also addicted to comfort and staying in your bubble.</p>\n<p>Compare these two scenarios:</p>\n<h6 id=\"Scenario-A\"><a href=\"#Scenario-A\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Scenario A\"></a>Scenario A</h6><p>I spend 20 days out of 30 days in a month playing video games for hours  to rank up and watch 5 episodes on Netflix or HBO Go every day.</p>\n<p>Do you think I’ll look back at the end of the month and say “Wow, I’m so  proud of myself and the time I wasted to reach 100 hours of Valorant and finish 2 seasons of Euphoria?” Obviously not.</p>\n<h6 id=\"Scenario-B\"><a href=\"#Scenario-B\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Scenario B\"></a>Scenario B</h6><p>I spend 20 days in a month reading a chapter of a book, running 1km and  gradually increasing the distance, and only 1 hour of phone screen time. At the end of the month, I managed to increase my deep work and focus,  complete two books, and run 4km. Do you think I’ll look back and be  happy?</p>\n<p>Of course, I conquered the month, managed to achieve my goal, and will  feel so satisfied with the hard work I did. I practice delayed  gratification which means sacrificing my comfort daily for long-term  satisfaction. I know I’m getting slightly better from the other guys  similar to me last month that are still jerking off twice daily to this  day.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Which scenario, which part of me do you think is more attractive from my  crush’s eyes or anyone from the opposite sex? If you’re a woman reading  this, this can be an insight for you to choose your partner properly or  just assume I’m a woman too. I’m not asking you to do self-improvement  to fish for compliments. This is just to highlight which is good and  bad.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, will your future self be proud of you for finishing two  shows in a month? Will your future self be happy for you for wasting  hundreds of hours on video games, Netflix, social media or weed when you have the time and choice to do something better like reading or  sleeping early? You already know the answer.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to start with big and hard challenges. If you can’t even run for 1km, try 500m first. If you fap 10 times a week, reduce it to 5. If you’re always on your phone for 5 hours, reduce it to 4. But don’t stay at the same place for a long time.
