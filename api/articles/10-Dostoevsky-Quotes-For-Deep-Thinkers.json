When our personal heroes manage to satisfy our demands, we run out of positive adjectives to describe them. <strong>When  someone becomes an opposite force pushing us further from where we  desired to be, we run out of derogatory adjectives to describe that  person.</strong></p>\n<p>And the same applies to our self-judgment. We, humans, are simple if we  understand the basics. There are a few laws.

The  former is romantic in nature while the latter could mean sympathy, pity, and even awe.</p>\n<p>The opposite of being in love is <em>loathe</em>. The opposite of loving is hating.</p>\n<p>You can be in love with a person, and still hate that person’s behavior, character, and actions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"3-Above-all-do-not-lie-to-yourself-A-man-who-lies-to-himself-and-listens-to-his-own-lie-comes-to-a-point-where-he-does-not-discern-any-truth-either-in-himself-or-anywhere-around-him-and-thus-falls-into-disrespect-towards-himself-and-others\"><a href=\"#3-Above-all-do-not-lie-to-yourself-A-man-who-lies-to-himself-and-listens-to-his-own-lie-comes-to-a-point-where-he-does-not-discern-any-truth-either-in-himself-or-anywhere-around-him-and-thus-falls-into-disrespect-towards-himself-and-others\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3.

It will lead to you losing both the ability and the will  to look at things truly.</p>\n<p>You will start deceiving yourself. All you will try to do is convince  yourself and others that your point-of-view is the only truth and the  only real way of looking at things. <strong>That is, you lie and falsify everything to both advance and defend your perspective and actions.</strong> You will not only spit lies but also swallow them.</p>\n<p>And what will all this lead to?</p>\n<p>You lose the respect of others and therefore of yourself.</p>\n<p>You lose the respect of others because they can see through you. They  can see that you are unoriginal, unworthy and self-deceiving. And hence, they decode your game. It doesn’t matter to them if they are the same.  We all like to spit on others, remember?</p>\n<p>And once we perceive ourselves being disrespected by others — it’s impossible for us to respect ourselves.</p>\n<h5 id=\"2-For-there-are-two-sorts-of-mind-one-that-matters-and-one-that-doesn’t-matter\"><a href=\"#2-For-there-are-two-sorts-of-mind-one-that-matters-and-one-that-doesn’t-matter\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2.
