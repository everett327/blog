I am no expert in this but I began  to read a little bit about attention and about a week ago, I read an  article that completely changed my perspective about distraction, in the first place.

But  soon enough, as the weather keeps changing there are a few parasites  that begin to pop up on the trunk of the apple tree and sometimes in the branches of the apple tree.</p>\n<p>Now, if you look at the size of the parasite, it looks very insignificant  but if you don’t kill that parasite, soon enough the entire tree is  going to rot because the parasite is going to suck all of its nutrients.</p>\n<p>Distraction to our mind is just like the parasite to a healthy apple tree. With all this humungous potential in our mind if we let the parasite of  distraction grow into our mind we will never be able to utilize our mind to its full potential, eventually, it is going to end up killing us,  not us but our dreams. And if you only understand the depth of this  story very well you will begin to take distraction very very seriously.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>So, I’m just gonna give you a few takeaways by which I just hope that you  will be able to pay much more attention to what you’re doing right now.  and what is important, without actually getting distracted, eventually  utilizing the potential of your mind a little bit more.</p>\n<p>So, here’s a thing that you are supposed to know. People, every time you  pick up something to work on and every time you are reading a book you  need to understand that your brain is forming possibly a million, a  billion neurological connections eventually, to help you understand the  information properly to turn that information into knowledge and to turn that knowledge into wisdom so that it can help you enhance your life.</p>\n<p>And when this process is happening, your brain is exercising a superpower  that no other species possesses. Eventually, taking up a lot of energy  to process every bit of the information that you are producing.</p>\n<p>But you know what? because this is never really told to us, we take it for  granted. And that’s the reason why the superpower that you have been  practicing never really gets utilized to its fullest eventually, to  never get utilized at all because we never focus.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p><strong>So the question is- What exactly is the root cause of this problem and how exactly are we supposed to tackle it?</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing that I want you to know is understand how does the technology around you work in the first place.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People, companies spend a billion dollars to make sure that they make Instagram a part of your lifestyle.</li>\n<li>It’s not a coincidence that you open Instagram every time you’re bored.</li>\n<li>It’s not a coincidence that when you are in a restaurant and everybody is  talking when you feel out of the conversation, you open up Instagram.</li>\n<li>It’s not a coincidence but a strategic move that has been planned by some of the best behavioral scientists in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And it’s not a bad thing because that’s how business is done but it becomes a bad thing once it begins to intrude into your life so much that it  becomes a hurdle for your progress. And the one who is supposed to act  on it is not Instagram but you.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p><strong>So, here’s a very simple 3 step procedure by which I have been able to focus on my work and I just hope it helps you focus on your work too.</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing that you’re supposed to do is segregate all the applications in your phone into 3 categories.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first category, you can call it ‘Important’.</li>\n<li>The second category is ‘Not so Important’.</li>\n<li>And the third category is ‘Not at all Important’.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, in my ‘Not at all important’ category, I have Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon,  and Flipkart. And the first thing that you’re supposed to do after you  find out all of these not at all important applications is to turn off  their notifications.</p>\n<p>Now, the question is- What happens with Zomato? Zomato is not like Instagram then why should you switch off the notification?</p>\n<p>Well, you have to switch off the notification because When you are working on something very very important, you will get a Zomato notification, you  will open up the Zomato application and then you will understand that  your friend just called you and told you that Dhoni just retired “OH MY  GOD, DHONI JUST RETIRED!” so you begin to see Instagram posts about  Dhoni and then you begin to see YouTube videos on 3 best Dhoni moments,  eventually to enter into a Sushant Singh Rajput video because Dhoni is  related to Sushant Singh Rajput and god knows within 5 minutes you’re  watching this. The entire day is gone.</p>\n<p>And that’s the reason why you have to turn off the notifications of Zomato  and all other applications which will give you an excuse to pick up your phone.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p><strong>The second category</strong> is ‘Not so important and here’s where you have to turn off the  notifications of all the groups that you have on WhatsApp wherein you  have ‘good morning’ and ‘good evening’ messages. Why? Because the ‘Good  morning’ and ‘Good evening’ messages are not dangerous. They just give  you an excuse to pick up the phone and soon enough you’ll get a message  from your friend [THE CYCLE REPEATS].</p>\n<p>And that’s the reason why you’re supposed to turn off the notifications for all the insignificant groups that you are a part of.</p>\n<p>Now, people, I want to leave this completely up to you and your maturity to  decide which of those applications and which of the notifications in  those applications are a priority in your life; because everybody has  different priorities.</p>\n<p>This is the first step to actually increasing your focus and decreasing your distraction to help you put in much more work and to utilize the  potential of your mind. And every time you feel the reluctance to turn  off the notifications in your phone always tell yourself one thing</p>\n<blockquote><span class=\"custom-blockquote-svg\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" data-reactroot=\"\">\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M22 12C22 6.5 17.5 2 12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12C2 17.5 6.5 22 12 22C13.8 22 15.5 21.5 17 20.6L22 22L20.7 17C21.5 15.5 22 13.8 22 12Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M17 8.5C15.23 8.97 14.07 10.84 14.01 13.27C14 13.33 14 13.4 14 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M9 8.5C7.23 8.97 6.07 10.84 6.01 13.27C6 13.33 6 13.4 6 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n</svg>\n</span><p>“If you don’t kill distraction, distraction will kill your dreams.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>And I’m 100% sure that you will have more persistence to turn off the notifications to improvise your life.</p>\n<p>And this is what reminds me of what Ray Kroc once said when he was asked  what exactly was his secret to building a $700 million food chain empire at the age of 52.
