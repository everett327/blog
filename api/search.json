Sleeping late and waking up late, being on social media for an ungodly  number of hours, playing video games, watching Netflix and YouTube,  never exercising, and having low motivation. After years of doing the  same thing, every time I wake up, I feel like it’s just another boring  day.\nI saw a lot of tweets from people around my age saying they are bored.  Their life is boring and I thought it was normal and it’s a part of  growing up. Dumb me. One of the reasons I stay away from Twitter is they can unconsciously influence your thinking. If it’s a good one, that’s  great but from my experience, the bad outweighs the good.\nAfter watching a video from Hamza last night (link at the end of this post), I finally know why my life is boring and why I feel sooo weak a failure,  and pathetic. Sometimes depressed. You must have felt like that too, I  know.\nIt’s actually because of the things I did like social media, Netflix, porn,  video games, and so on. My life is boring because it’s full of the “fun  and entertainment” stuff that normal people do.\nThe reason for that is because they are instant gratification activities.  It’s instant, easy and comfortable. You don’t have to use your  brainpower too much and there is no resistance for you to have “fun”.  They say comfort kills a man, it’s true. It kills your happiness and fulfillment in the long run.\nThe more nonsense and unbeneficial content you pay attention to,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe more Netflix you watch, the more video games you play, the more junk food you eat, the more porn you indulge, the more weed you smoke, the  more your life gets boring and miserable.\nThese activities only give you the “happiness”, “fun” and “enjoyment” only  when you are locked in it. As soon as you finish the game, that episode, scrolling till the bottom, jerking off, and so on, you are left with  the reality. And reality gets slightly worse the more you do those  activities.\nIf you consume nothing but escapist entertainment, you will find the real world around you harder and harder to deal with.\nI strongly believe on you are what you consume, or you are what you pay  attention to. It can be food, content or the people you choose to be  close with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Tell me to what you pay attention and I will tell you who you are.” — Jose Ortega y Gasset\nYour life gets boring because you don’t challenge yourself. You are also addicted to comfort and staying in your bubble.\nCompare these two scenarios:\nScenario AI spend 20 days out of 30 days in a month playing video games for hours  to rank up and watch 5 episodes on Netflix or HBO Go every day.\nDo you think I’ll look back at the end of the month and say “Wow, I’m so  proud of myself and the time I wasted to reach 100 hours of Valorant and finish 2 seasons of Euphoria?” Obviously not.\nScenario BI spend 20 days in a month reading a chapter of a book, running 1km and  gradually increasing the distance, and only 1 hour of phone screen time. At the end of the month, I managed to increase my deep work and focus,  complete two books, and run 4km. Do you think I’ll look back and be  happy?\nOf course, I conquered the month, managed to achieve my goal, and will  feel so satisfied with the hard work I did. I practice delayed  gratification which means sacrificing my comfort daily for long-term  satisfaction. I know I’m getting slightly better from the other guys  similar to me last month that are still jerking off twice daily to this  day.\n…\nWhich scenario, which part of me do you think is more attractive from my  crush’s eyes or anyone from the opposite sex? If you’re a woman reading  this, this can be an insight for you to choose your partner properly or  just assume I’m a woman too. I’m not asking you to do self-improvement  to fish for compliments. This is just to highlight which is good and  bad.\nMost importantly, will your future self be proud of you for finishing two  shows in a month? Will your future self be happy for you for wasting  hundreds of hours on video games, Netflix, social media or weed when you have the time and choice to do something better like reading or  sleeping early? You already know the answer.\nYou don’t have to start with big and hard challenges. If you can’t even run for 1km, try 500m first. If you fap 10 times a week, reduce it to 5. If you’re always on your phone for 5 hours, reduce it to 4. But don’t stay at the same place for a long time. Try to be better 1 percent every  single day because as James Clear said in his book, Atomic Habits:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1% worse every day for one year. 0.99^365 &#x3D; 00.03\n1% better every day for one year. 1.01^365 &#x3D; 37.78\nSmall bad habits repeated every single day will make you worse and worse.  Small good habits repeated every single day will make you better and  better. Small wins lead to bigger wins. Just like a spark that can  spread and grow to burn the entire forest into ashes.\nOne more thing, if you want to be successful and improve in your life. Remember this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccess is the product of daily habits. — James Clear\nIf you like this post, share this to your friend that needs it or on your story.

Every Day","content":"——An unconventional and compassionate guide to becoming an early bird\nI thought I was destined to be a night owl forever.\nI’m no stranger to reading about the benefits of waking up early or having  the same sleeping routine — all of us have probably read this at some  point in our lives. I’m in my final semester of university, so the past  few years of my life have been absolute chaos. I have classes some days, work other days, and have free time on especially rare days. Having a  routine seemed impossible.\nBut a few months ago, I started reading Haruki Murakami’s novels. My favorite is Norwegian Wood. Inspired by Murakami’s fascinating prose, I researched him a little.\nI found this gem in a 2004 interview he did:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I’m in writing mode for a novel, I get up at 4 a.m. and work for  five to six hours. In the afternoon, I run for ten kilometers or swim  for fifteen hundred meters (or do both), then I read a bit and listen to some music. I go to bed at 9 p.m.\nI keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition  itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism. I  mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind.\nBut to hold to such repetition for so long — six months to a year —  requires a good amount of mental and physical strength. In that sense,  writing a long novel is like survival training. Physical strength is as  necessary as artistic sensitivity.\nThere’s something about the way Murakami talks about his routine that moved me. This part, in particular, stood out to me:\nThe repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism.\nMesmerism has been a part of my life since I was a child; it’s the sense I have  every time I establish a new habit. I mesmerized myself as a child to  brush my teeth every day in the morning. As an adult, I’ve mesmerized  myself to be healthy by exercising regularly. I’ve mesmerized myself to  reflect on my life by adding a journaling routine.\nA surge of motivation struck me, knowing I had done a similar task in the past. I could become an early bird by mesmerizing myself.\nFor the past 3 months, I’ve successfully transitioned into being an early  bird. I go to sleep at 9 p.m. on average 6-7 nights a week. I currently  wake up between 5–5:30 a.m. naturally.\nI might continue experimenting with waking up even earlier, but I’m happy with my current routine and don’t want to put too much pressure on  myself. After all, it’s healthy to get 8 hours of sleep, isn’t it?\nI’ve tried to become an early bird many times in my life and this is the  first time it has actually worked. Here’s what this process of  “mesmerizing” myself looked like—and also a few words about what doesn’t work.\nWhat really worked was more gentle than you might expect. Consider this, then, a compassionate guide to waking up early.\n…\nClarify Your Purpose for Waking Up EarlyWaking up before everyone else is tough. If you don’t have a reason to do it, you won’t do it.\nI don’t just mean purpose in the sense that you want to wake up to do  something. Of course, you’re going to wake up early to do something  (probably productive). But you need a purpose that extends past a basic  task.\nI’m about to graduate from university and I’m about to enter arguably the  most important years of my life — years where I’ll have both money and  freedom. If I ever want a chance at escaping at the 9–5, I have to do  something now. Working in the morning is easier than working at night,  so I need to set up my habits now so I can be living that life later.\nYou might already have a purpose, but if you don’t, try running a 5 Whys analysis (otherwise known as root cause analysis).\nTo do the 5 Whys:\n\nForm a problem statement.\nAsk the question: “Why is&#x2F;are&#x2F;does [your problem statement]?”. Use your answer as the next problem statement.\nKeep asking “why” until you’ve asked it five or more times.\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to wake up at 5 a.m. every day.\nWhy do you want to wake up at 5 a.m. every day?\nI want more time to be productive.\nWhy do you want to be more productive?\nI want to practice writing.\nWhy do you want to practice writing?\nI want to write books.\nWhy do you want to write books?\nI want to have a career doing something creative.\nWhy do you want to have a career doing something creative?\nI imagine it to be the most fulfilling thing someone can do in their career.\nStarting with a smaller problem and going deep to find the root cause helps you  gain a better understanding of what you really want. It’ll help you  understand if waking up is part of the solution to your problem.\nWaking up early gives you a few hours every day in the morning where nobody  else is going to disturb you. That’s all it is for most of us. For me,  though, that’s an important part of my solution to escaping a 9–5 rut  and doing work I love.\n…\nUnderstand What You Gain and LoseWhen I first tried to become an early riser, I didn’t consider what I have  to give up. I failed because I wasn’t willing to give up the things I  enjoyed, like my weekday social life. I would go out, say I’d wake up  early despite getting home late, and ultimately wake up late.\nIf you accept what you lose upfront, you won’t keep trying to hold onto it when it’s gone.\nBut let’s be optimistic and start with what you’ll gain.\nWhat are you gain?Being an early bird means you get a few hours every day to do whatever you  want. It’s likely nobody else will be awake to disturb you. You can  paint, start a business, write — anything you want.\nYour prefrontal cortex is most active right after waking up, making it  optimal for creativity. I’ve noticed I write much faster in the morning  than at any other time in the day. Looking at the habits of famous  writers, a lot of them have figured it out too (most authors write in  the morning).\nIt’s a big win: a few hours of solitude with your most creative self.\nWhat are you lose?There’s no free lunch. Waking up early doesn’t give you extra time. It takes  off time you would otherwise have at night — unless you sleep less,  which is a bad idea. If you sleep less, you either won’t be able to wake up early and become a night owl again, or you’ll be sleep-deprived and  unproductive throughout the day.\nIn reality, I lost time since I started waking up early. I used to sleep  for 6 hours and wake up from the urgency to get up and get to work. I  can’t do that when I’m waking up early because there’s no urgency for me to get out of bed; I’m weak. So I sleep for 8 hours. Otherwise, the  temptation to stay in bed would be too much.\nI’ve lost around 2 hours every day—but I feel rested throughout the day.\nRunning out of timeI finish work at 5 p.m. (haha, 9–5). That means I have 4 hours after work before I sleep. But there are a few things I need to do within that  time:\n\nCommute (1 hour)\nCook and eat (1 hour)\nExercise (1 hour)\nWind down (1 hour)\n\nThat adds up to 4 hours. There’s no time left to do anything else. Of  course, these activities don’t always take an hour each, but you get the point. Winding down is especially important for me. I tried a lot of  ways to get around it, but I ended up not being able to sleep.\nTo keep my sanity, I have dinner with friends on days I don’t exercise.  Still, there’s a limited time I can spend with them (around 2 hours).\nIt feels like I’m living in a box, but I can’t say it’s all been bad.  Being able to keep up this habit makes me feel eccentric and in some  way, special.\nI used to watch the life of bodybuilders and wonder how they do it; all they do is eat, train and sleep. They don’t do anything else.\nNow I understand them. There’s a sense of purpose that comes with living in a box. You know you’re disciplining yourself for a goal.\nGive yourself one day off per weekI’ve found that if I mess up my sleep schedule one day a week, I can still  maintain it throughout the week. I tried sleeping late two or three days a week — it didn’t work. But one seems to be okay.\nI love going out at night, so I’ve given myself one day a week (usually Friday) to hang out with friends for longer.\nIf this is something you need to do to wake up early, I suggest you set  rules for it, too. You’re less likely to fail with disciplined chaos  than pure chaos. Give yourself one day a week where you’re allowed to  break the rules to mitigate what you feel you are losing.\nCompare the benefits with the costAsk yourself these two questions:\n\nWhat will I gain with the extra time in the morning?\nWhat will I lose with the lost time at night?\n\nThen ask yourself: “Do the benefits outweigh the costs?”\nIf they don’t, then there’s probably no point in waking up early. If they  do, there are a few things that helped me that’ll probably help you.\n…\nFocus on Sleeping TimeWhen I told myself I was going to wake up at 5 a.m. no matter what, I  failed. I’d do it if I slept too late. I’d do it if I stayed out late at night. I’d do it if I stayed up studying.\nThis didn’t work. I don’t know what I was trying to do by trying to cheat the system, thinking my willpower was enough.\nThis might work for people who have this habit already. But if you’re starting out, focus on one thing: sleeping time.\nGet enough sleepA common mistake people make is thinking they can sleep the same amount  as they usually do. For example, I only slept for 6 hours before, so I  thought I could sleep for 6 hours and still wake up early. This doesn’t  work because you end up sleeping in; it’s unlikely you have any  willpower when it’s pitch black outside.\nFor the best chances at waking up early, set a goal for 8 hours of sleep. I want to wake up at 5 a.m., so my sleeping time is 9 p.m. (8 hours  before).\nSleep more than needed (when you start)When I started, I didn’t set my alarm at 5 a.m. I set no alarm at all. With  drastic changes to your sleeping schedule, you’re going to need some  time to adjust. You initially need more sleep.\nYou have the rest of your life to wake up early. Spend some time now  getting the habit into your routine. This is a marathon, not a sprint.\nWaking up early means waking up when it’s still dark. Give your body some time to adjust to the darkness. It took me about a week; it might be longer  or shorter for you.\nI naturally woke up earlier and earlier every day. Now I can successfully wake up at 5 a.m. every day.\n…\nDon’t Try to Change EverythingYou can’t introduce too much change to your life at once. Changing your  sleeping pattern is a big change. I know you want to wake up and do  something productive right away. You want to do all the amazing things  you couldn’t do before.\nBe patient. If you don’t, you’re not going to be able to do any amazing things at all.\nYou can’t change too much at onceIf it helps to get some empathy, imagine the life of someone who seriously needs help. An archetype would be the 30-year-old man-child who still  lives in his parents’ basement and plays video games all day.\nIf you were giving him life advice, it would be something like:\n\nGet a job.\nFix your diet.\nGo to the gym every day.\nRead books.\nDo a side project.\n\nCan you imagine how they would do that? They can’t do all of these things  at once! If you told them to change everything at once, it would be so  overwhelming they’d stay in their old habits. You’d have more compassion for them and help them make those changes over time.\nI can barely fix my diet and go to the gym at the same time, and I’d like to consider myself a healthily integrated member of society.\nSimilarly, you should only change one thing at a time. For now, focus on getting to sleep early. That’s all.\nSlowly increase your productivity as you go. If your goal is to get work done  in the morning, start by doing 30 minutes of work, then an hour, and so  on.\nHave fun in the morning (when you start)If there’s a day you wake up feeling super motivated and ready to do work, then, by all means, do it. But if you don’t feel motivated at the  start, just have fun.\nI spent around two weeks waking up in the morning and watching TV shows,  YouTube or Twitch streams. It was actually fun — watching stuff when  nobody else was around.\nEventually, I was ready to do work. Trust me, you’ll eventually be ready to do  work. There’s no way you’re going to wake up every morning to mess  around for the rest of your life (if your goal is to be productive);  it’ll feel like such a waste.\n…\nChoose a Morning RoutineEven after waking up early for months, I still have trouble getting out of  bed without my morning routine. I tried to skip it a few times, but it  felt wrong — as if my morning routine is part of the process of waking  up.\nA morning routine not only prepares you for the day, but it mesmerizes  you. Before my routine, I’m groggy and tired. After, I’m excited and  awake. It’s the closest thing to magic I’ve found.\nIt’s like my brain is telling me: “now that you’ve completed the first task of the day, you’re ready to wake up.”\nI journal for my morning routine — specifically, I do morning pages. It’s an exercise from Julia Cameron’s Artist’s Way where you write 3 longhand pages without stopping to think. It’s  designed to unblock artists by teaching them that perfection isn’t  necessary to create.\nInstead of 3 A4 pages, I do 4 A5 pages. I don’t know if they’re the same  amount, but the exact amount of words you write doesn’t matter. It’s  pretty close though.\nI keep a journal and pen next to my bed. They’re the first thing I touch (after turning the lights on) after waking up.\nA routine that suits youYou might already have a morning routine or have one in mind you want to try. Or you could also do morning pages.\nHere are some other practices I recommend for morning routines:\n\nMeditation\nYoga\nMaking tea\n\nThe actual routine doesn’t matter — at least for waking up. You’ll get  different benefits from different routines but the goal is to help you  wake up. You want to teach your body what to do when you wake up.\n…\nGet an Alarm That Works for YouIf there’s one piece of advice with alarms I would give, it’s this: don’t  use an alarm to wake you up; instead, use it as an insurance policy.\nWhen I first started using alarms, I used them to try to cheat sleep. When  you use alarms this way, you end up waking up groggy and tired because  you didn’t get enough sleep in the first place.\nIf you don’t want to end up hating your alarm, make sure you set the time  to the time after you want to wake up. I set it 8.5 hours after my  bedtime and I wake up without it.\nExperiment with alarmsIf you haven’t experimented with alarms before, you should. Different  alarms suit different people. Do a quick Google search for alarms.\nThere are all sorts of alarms out there. There are smart alarms, alarms that  only work if you step out of your bed, and even phone apps where someone calls you to wake you up. The latter would never work for me, but I can see it working for someone very social.\nIf you don’t want to do your own research, I have a recommendation for you.\nTry a light alarmI use a light alarm. A light alarm wakes you up with light before it  wakes you up with sound. It starts shining a light 30 minutes before the time you set and slowly gets brighter and brighter. This is useful for  early birds because it’s dark early in the morning.\nI set it at 5:30 a.m., which means it starts shining at 5 a.m. I never  wake up to the sound; I always wake up to the light. It hasn’t been easy to create this habit, but since I’ve made sure I get enough sleep  first, the light is enough—I never have a jarring sound wake me up.\n…\nSleep Without Your PhoneIf you want a chance at being productive in the morning, you can’t sleep with your phone. It’s already hard to wake up before everyone else.  Don’t make it harder for yourself by giving yourself easy access to  addictive stimuli while you’re in bed.\nA boring sleeping environmentMake your sleeping environment as boring as possible. You don’t want to have any excitement before you sleep or after you wake up.\nThe most common culprit of entertainment in bed is the phone. If you have  something else that you love you use in bed like a tablet, I suggest you move that away too.\nThere are two goals this achieves:\n\nImproves sleep\nHelps with getting out of bed\n\nNo way around itBefore I put my phone in another room, I constantly checked it in bed. I would message my friends. I would check every social media app I had. I would watch YouTube to sleep. I thought it was good because I kept doing it  and I was so used to falling asleep with entertainment.\nAs long as your phone is within reach when you wake up, there’s an  incredible temptation to use it in bed. I don’t know about you but I’ve  stayed in bed for hours mucking around on my phone.\nI have no self-control at all, so I control my environment.\nPut your phone in another roomIt’s a simple idea, but not easy. It feels like you’re giving away your  baby. But the resistance is good. It means you’re killing an addiction.\nChoose a room with a place to charge your phone. This could be the living  room, kitchen, or in my case, a study room. Leave your phone there and  in the morning, check it after you’ve left your bed, not before.\n…\nUse Melatonin as InsuranceI’ve left the most controversial for last. If you don’t want to take any substances, you can skip this section.\nMelatonin is a natural hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Your body  produces it at night to help you sleep. But you can also take it as a  pill.\nYou can get it in the United States without a prescription. Since melatonin is found in some foods, the U.S. Dietary Supplement Health and  Education Act of 1994 allows it to be sold as a dietary supplement.\nDosageA 2001 study found that the ideal dosage is 0.3 mg. The lowest amount of a melatonin dose I’ve found is 1mg. If you can find 0.3 mg, then good for you. I  use 1mg and cut it into half (0.5 mg). It’s not exactly 0.3 mg, but it  works for me. I’ve tried different dosages, including up to 10 mg, and  none of them worked as well as taking less.\nRegulate your sleep scheduleIf you don’t get to sleep on time consistently, melatonin isn’t going to save you. I tried to cheat the system. It didn’t work.\nNevertheless, you’re sometimes going to fail. You might sleep too late. You might  have a coffee too late in the day. You might wake up in the afternoon  and have trouble sleeping early.\nI fail. I’m not a perfectly disciplined monk. When it happens, I take melatonin.\nEven though melatonin isn’t considered an addictive substance, be cautious.  There’s no evidence melatonin has dangerous effects, but you can build  up a tolerance for it.\nMy recommendation is to use melatonin when you mess up your sleep schedule and can’t get to sleep at your bedtime because you’re too awake — but  don’t allow that to happen too often.\n…\nI said a lot about sleep. That’s because most of waking up early is  sleeping early, and it isn’t easy to sleep early. There are sacrifices  to be made. If you’re willing to make them, you can become an early  bird.\nThere are glamorous parts to waking up early. You get to be productive. You  get the feeling of accomplishing something before anybody else does. You get hours of solitude in a solitude-deprived, technology-focused world. I love it.\n…\n说明参考文档：https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-wake-up-at-5-a-m-every-day-ceb02e29c802.\n","slug":"How-To-Wake-Up-at-5-A.M.-Every-Day","date":"2022-04-26T08:21:40.000Z","categories_index":"medium","tags_index":"blog","author_index":"Everett327"},{"id":"c82e7a9e39f525c73dd3316c9fdaebd8","title":"A Monk Taught Me How to Focus","content":"A very simple 3 step procedure by which I have been able to focus on my work.\nPeople, one of the most powerful things in the history of mankind is the attention of a human being.\nThe greatest scientific discoveries of all time, the greatest inventions of all time have come into existence because someone, somewhere managed to pay a little bit more importance to the intricacies of the world that  the world considered to be insignificant.\nThe reason why stand up comedians can give us such a wonderful time is that  they manage to pay attention to those little intricacies of our life  that we never really pay attention to.\nAnd most importantly, the reason you listen to me right now is, while the  world was busy in its hustle and bustle one man was paying very close  attention to this world and decided to challenge the status quo to think differently and to change the world forever.\nSo the question lies, while on one side, there are these people who have managed to master  this art of attention, on the other side there are people like you and  me who cannot even read a book for an hour without actually getting  distracted.\n…\nThe question is - How do we exactly master this art of attention?\nNow, people, I am no genius in this. I am no expert in this but I began  to read a little bit about attention and about a week ago, I read an  article that completely changed my perspective about distraction, in the first place. This article was written by a monk and the first line said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Distraction is like a parasite to the mind if you don’t kill your distraction, distraction will kill your dreams.”\nIf you look at an apple tree guys, an apple tree takes about 6 years to  start giving you fruits and when it starts giving you fruits it’s got  lush green leaves, beautiful fruits, and a very very strong trunk. But  soon enough, as the weather keeps changing there are a few parasites  that begin to pop up on the trunk of the apple tree and sometimes in the branches of the apple tree.\nNow, if you look at the size of the parasite, it looks very insignificant  but if you don’t kill that parasite, soon enough the entire tree is  going to rot because the parasite is going to suck all of its nutrients.\nDistraction to our mind is just like the parasite to a healthy apple tree. With all this humungous potential in our mind if we let the parasite of  distraction grow into our mind we will never be able to utilize our mind to its full potential, eventually, it is going to end up killing us,  not us but our dreams. And if you only understand the depth of this  story very well you will begin to take distraction very very seriously.\n…\nSo, I’m just gonna give you a few takeaways by which I just hope that you  will be able to pay much more attention to what you’re doing right now.  and what is important, without actually getting distracted, eventually  utilizing the potential of your mind a little bit more.\nSo, here’s a thing that you are supposed to know. People, every time you  pick up something to work on and every time you are reading a book you  need to understand that your brain is forming possibly a million, a  billion neurological connections eventually, to help you understand the  information properly to turn that information into knowledge and to turn that knowledge into wisdom so that it can help you enhance your life.\nAnd when this process is happening, your brain is exercising a superpower  that no other species possesses. Eventually, taking up a lot of energy  to process every bit of the information that you are producing.\nBut you know what? because this is never really told to us, we take it for  granted. And that’s the reason why the superpower that you have been  practicing never really gets utilized to its fullest eventually, to  never get utilized at all because we never focus.\n…\nSo the question is- What exactly is the root cause of this problem and how exactly are we supposed to tackle it?\nThe first thing that I want you to know is understand how does the technology around you work in the first place.\n\nPeople, companies spend a billion dollars to make sure that they make Instagram a part of your lifestyle.\nIt’s not a coincidence that you open Instagram every time you’re bored.\nIt’s not a coincidence that when you are in a restaurant and everybody is  talking when you feel out of the conversation, you open up Instagram.\nIt’s not a coincidence but a strategic move that has been planned by some of the best behavioral scientists in the world.\n\nAnd it’s not a bad thing because that’s how business is done but it becomes a bad thing once it begins to intrude into your life so much that it  becomes a hurdle for your progress. And the one who is supposed to act  on it is not Instagram but you.\n…\nSo, here’s a very simple 3 step procedure by which I have been able to focus on my work and I just hope it helps you focus on your work too.\nThe first thing that you’re supposed to do is segregate all the applications in your phone into 3 categories.\n\nThe first category, you can call it ‘Important’.\nThe second category is ‘Not so Important’.\nAnd the third category is ‘Not at all Important’.\n\nNow, in my ‘Not at all important’ category, I have Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon,  and Flipkart. And the first thing that you’re supposed to do after you  find out all of these not at all important applications is to turn off  their notifications.\nNow, the question is- What happens with Zomato? Zomato is not like Instagram then why should you switch off the notification?\nWell, you have to switch off the notification because When you are working on something very very important, you will get a Zomato notification, you  will open up the Zomato application and then you will understand that  your friend just called you and told you that Dhoni just retired “OH MY  GOD, DHONI JUST RETIRED!” so you begin to see Instagram posts about  Dhoni and then you begin to see YouTube videos on 3 best Dhoni moments,  eventually to enter into a Sushant Singh Rajput video because Dhoni is  related to Sushant Singh Rajput and god knows within 5 minutes you’re  watching this. The entire day is gone.\nAnd that’s the reason why you have to turn off the notifications of Zomato  and all other applications which will give you an excuse to pick up your phone.\n…\nThe second category is ‘Not so important and here’s where you have to turn off the  notifications of all the groups that you have on WhatsApp wherein you  have ‘good morning’ and ‘good evening’ messages. Why? Because the ‘Good  morning’ and ‘Good evening’ messages are not dangerous. They just give  you an excuse to pick up the phone and soon enough you’ll get a message  from your friend [THE CYCLE REPEATS].\nAnd that’s the reason why you’re supposed to turn off the notifications for all the insignificant groups that you are a part of.\nNow, people, I want to leave this completely up to you and your maturity to  decide which of those applications and which of the notifications in  those applications are a priority in your life; because everybody has  different priorities.\nThis is the first step to actually increasing your focus and decreasing your distraction to help you put in much more work and to utilize the  potential of your mind. And every time you feel the reluctance to turn  off the notifications in your phone always tell yourself one thing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“If you don’t kill distraction, distraction will kill your dreams.”\nAnd I’m 100% sure that you will have more persistence to turn off the notifications to improvise your life.\nAnd this is what reminds me of what Ray Kroc once said when he was asked  what exactly was his secret to building a $700 million food chain empire at the age of 52. And he responded by saying one-word “Persistence”\n“Nothing in this world can take place of good old persistence\n\nTalent won’t because nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.\nGenius won’t because unrecognized genius is practically a cliché.\nAnd lastly, education won’t because the world is full of educated fools.\n\nPersistence and determination alone are all-powerful.” And at the end of the day, people, the question is all about one thing.\nDo you have the persistence to kill your distraction or are you going to let it kill your dreams?\n…\n说明参考文档：https://betterhumans.pub/a-monk-taught-me-how-to-focus-17068bafc678.\n","slug":"A-Monk-Taught-Me-How-to-Focus","date":"2022-04-26T08:06:53.000Z","categories_index":"medium","tags_index":"blog","author_index":"Everett327"},{"id":"0f653fcff83ad59dc2b9f9926c19a28b","title":"21 Quotes That (If Applied) Change You Into a Better Person","content":"As long as man has been alive, he has been collecting little sayings  about how to live. We find them carved in the rock of the Temple of  Apollo and etched as graffiti on the walls of Pompeii. They appear in  the plays of Shakespeare, the commonplace book of H. P. Lovecraft, the collected proverbs of Erasmus, and the ceiling  beams of Montaigne’s study. Today, they’re recorded on iPhones and in  Evernote.\nBut whatever generation is doing it, whether they’re written by scribes in  China or commoners in some European dungeon or simply passed along by a  kindly grandfather, these little epigrams of life advice have taught  essential lessons. How to respond to adversity. How to think about  money. How to meditate on our mortality. How to have courage.\nAnd they pack all this in in so few words. “What is an epigram?” Coleridge  asked, “A dwarfish whole; Its body brevity, and wit its soul.” Epigrams  are what Churchill was doing when he said: “To improve is to change, so  to be perfect is to have changed often.” Or Balzac: “All happiness  depends on courage and work.” Ah yes, epigrams are often funny too.  That’s how we remember them. Napoleon: “Never interrupt an enemy making a mistake.” François de La Rochefoucauld: “We hardly find any persons of  good sense save those who agree with us.” Voltaire: “A long dispute  means that both parties are wrong.”\nBelow are some wonderful epigrams that span some 21 centuries and 3  continents. Each one is worth remembering, having queued in your brain  for one of life’s crossroads or to drop at the perfect moment in  conversation. Each will change and evolve with you as you evolve  (Heraclitus: “No man steps in the same river twice”) and yet each will  remain strong and unyielding no matter how much you may one day try to  wiggle out and away from them.\nFundamentally, each one will teach you how to be a better person. If you let them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We must all either wear out or rust out, every one of us. My choice is to wear out.” — Theodore Roosevelt\nAt the beginning of his life, few would have predicted that Theodore Roosevelt even had a choice in the matter. He was sickly and fragile, doted on by worried parents. Then, a conversation with his father sent him driven,  almost maniacally in the other direction. “I will make my body,” he said, when told that he would not go far in this world with a  brilliant mind in a frail body. What followed was a montage of boxing,  hiking, horseback riding, hunting, fishing, swimming, boldly charging  enemy fire, and then a grueling work pace as one of the most prolific  and admired presidents in American history. Again, this epigram was  prophetic for Roosevelt, because at only 54 years old, his body began to wear out. An assassination attempt left a bullet lodged in his body and it hastened his rheumatoid arthritis. On his famous “River of Doubt” expedition he developed a tropical fever and the toxins from an  infection in his leg left him nearly dead. Back in America he contracted a severe throat infection and was later diagnosed with inflammatory  rheumatism, which temporarily confined him to a wheelchair (saying  famously, “All right! I can work that way too!”) and then he died at age 60. But there is not a person on the planet who would say that he had  not made a fair trade, that he had not worn his life well and not lived a full one in those 60 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.” — Epictetus\nThere is the story of the alcoholic father with two sons. One follows in his father’s footsteps and ends up struggling through life as a drunk,  and the other becomes a successful, sober businessman. Each are asked:  “Why are you the way you are?” The answer for both is the same: “Well,  it’s because my father was an alcoholic.” The same event, the same  childhood, two different outcomes. This is true for almost all  situations — what happens to us is an objective reality, how we respond  is a subjective choice. The Stoics — of which Epictetus was one — would say that we don’t control what happens to us, all we control  are our thoughts and reactions to what happens to us. Remember that:  You’re defined in this life not by your good luck or your bad luck, but  your reaction to those strokes of fortune. Don’t let anyone tell you  different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The best revenge is not to be like that.” — Marcus Aurelius\nThere is a proverb about revenge: Before setting out for a journey of revenge, dig two graves. Because revenge is so costly, because the pursuit of it often wears on  the one who covets it. Marcus’s advice is easier and truer: How much  better it feels to let it go, to leave the wrongdoer to their  wrongdoing. And from what we know, Marcus Aurelius lived this advice. When Avidius Cassius, one of his most trusted  generals rebelled and declared himself emperor, Marcus did not seek  vengeance. Instead, he saw this as an opportunity to teach the Roman  people and the Roman Senate about how to deal with civil strife in a  compassionate, forgiving way. Indeed, when assassins struck Cassius  down, Marcus supposedly wept. This is very different than the idea of  “Living well being the best revenge” — it’s not about showing someone up or rubbing your success in their face. It’s that the person who wronged you is not happy, is not enjoying their life. Do not become like them.  Reward yourself by being the opposite of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“There is good in everything, if only we look for it.” — Laura Ingalls Wilder\nLaura Ingalls Wilder, author of the classic series Little House, lived this, facing some of the toughest and unwelcoming elements on the planet: harsh and unyielding soil, Indian territory, Kansas prairies,  and the humid backwoods of Florida. Not afraid, not jaded — because she  saw it all as an adventure. Everywhere was a chance to do something new, to persevere with cheery pioneer spirit whatever fate befell her and  her husband. That isn’t to say she saw the world through delusional  rose-colored glasses. Instead, she simply chose to see each situation  for what it could be — accompanied by hard work and a little upbeat  spirit. Others make the opposite choice. Remember: There is no good or  bad without us, there is only perception. There is the event itself and  the story we tell ourselves about what it means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Character is fate.” — Heraclitus\nIn the hiring process, most employers look at where someone went to  school, what jobs they’ve held in the past. This is because past success can be an indicator of future successes. But is it always? There are  plenty of people who were successful because of luck. Maybe they got  into Oxford or Harvard because of their parents. And what about a young  person who hasn’t had time to build a track record? Are they worthless?  Of course not. This is why character is a far better measure of a man or woman. Not just for jobs, but for friendships,  relationships, for everything. When you seek to advance your own  position in life, character is the best lever — perhaps not in the short term, but certainly over the long term. And the same goes for the  people you invite into your life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.” — Nicholas Nassim Taleb\nA man shows up for work at a company where he knows that management is  doing something wrong, something unethical. How does he respond? Can he  cash his checks in good conscience because he isn’t the one running up  the stock price, falsifying reports or lying to his co-workers? No. One  cannot, as Budd Schulberg says in one of his novels, deal in filth without becoming the thing he touches. We should look up  to a young man at Theranos as an example here. After discovering  numerous problems at the health care startup, he was dismissed by his  seniors and eventually contacted the authorities. Afterwards, not only  was this young man repeatedly threatened, bullied, and attacked by  Theranos, but his family had to consider selling their house to pay for  the legal bills. His relationship with his grandfather — who sits on the Theranos board — is strained and perhaps irreparable. As Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, and us: “Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn’t matter.”  It’s an important reminder. Doing the right thing isn’t free. Doing the  right thing might even cost you everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson\nEveryone is better than you at something. This is a fact of life.  Someone is better than you at making eye contact. Someone is better than you at quantum physics. Someone is better informed than you on  geopolitics. Someone is better than you are at speaking kindly to  someone they dislike. There are better gift-givers, name-rememberers,  weight-lifters, temper-controllers, confidence-carriers, and  friendship-makers. There is no one person who is the best at all these things, who doesn’t have room to improve in one or more of them.  So if you can find the humility to accept this about yourself, what you  will realize is that the world is one giant classroom. Go about your day with an openness and a joy about this fact. Look at every interaction  as an opportunity to learn from and of the people you meet. You will be  amazed at how quickly you grow, how much better you get.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This is not your responsibility but it is your problem.” — Cheryl Strayed\nIt is not your responsibility to fill up a stranger’s gas tank, but when their car dies in front of you, blocking the road, it’s still your  problem isn’t it? It is not your responsibility to negotiate peace  treaties on behalf of your country, but when war breaks out and you’re  drafted to fight in it? Guess whose problem it is? Yours. Life is like this. It has a way of dropping things into our lap — the  consequences of an employee’s negligence, a spouse’s momentary lapse of  judgement, a freak weather event — that were in no way our fault but by  nature of being in our lap, our f*cking problem. So what are you going to do? Complain? Are you going to litigate this in a blogpost or an argument with God?  Or are you just going to get to work solving it the best you can? Life  is defined by how you answer that question. Cheryl Strayed is right. This thing might not be your responsibility but it is your problem. So accept it, deal with it, kick its ass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.” — Marcus Aurelius\nIn Rome just as America, in the forum just as on Facebook, there was the temptation to replace action with argument. To philosophize instead of living philosophically. Today, in a society obsessed with content, outrage, and drama, it’s even easier to get lost in the echo chamber of the  debate of what’s “better.” We can have endless discussions about what’s  right and wrong. What should we do in this hypothetical situation or  that one? How can we encourage other people to be better? (We can even  debate the meaning of the above line: “What’s a man? What’s the  definition of good? Why doesn’t it mention women?”) Of course, this is  all a distraction. If you want to try to make the world a slightly  better place, there’s a lot you can do. But only one thing guarantees an impact. Step away from the argument. Dig yourself out of the rubble.  Stop wasting time with how things should be, would be, could be. Be that thing. (Here’s a cool poster of this quote).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“You are only entitled to the action, never to its fruits.” — Bhagavad Gita\nIn life, it’s a fact that: You will be unappreciated. You will be  sabotaged. You will experience surprising failures. Your expectations  will not be met. You will lose. You will fail. How do you carry on then? How do you take pride in yourself and your work? John Wooden’s advice  to his players says it: Change the definition of success. “Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self  satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become  the best that you are capable of becoming.” “Ambition,” Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, “means tying your well-being to what other people say or do . . .  Sanity means tying it to your own actions.” Do your work. Do it well.  Then “let go and let God.” That’s all there needs to be. Recognition and rewards — those are just extra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Self-sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth.” — Epicurus\nA lot has been said of so-called “Fck You Money.” The idea being that  if one can earn enough, become rich and powerful enough, that suddenly  no one can touch them and they can do whatever they want. What a mirage  this is! How often the target seems to mysteriously move right as we  approach it. It calls to mind the observation of David “DHH” Heinemeier  Hansson who said that “beyond a specific amount, fck-you money can be a state of mind. One  that you can acquire well in advance of the corresponding bank account.  One that’s founded mostly on a personal confidence that even if most of  the material trappings went away, you’d still be happier for standing  your ground.” The truth is being your own man, being self-contained,  having fewer needs, and better, resilient skills that allow you to  thrive in any and all situations. That is real wealth and freedom.  That’s what Emerson was talking about in his famous essay on self-reliance and it’s what Epicurus meant too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Tell me to what you pay attention and I will tell you who you are.” — Jose Ortega y Gasset\nIt was one of the great Stoics who said that if you live with a lame man, soon enough you will walk  with a limp. My father told me something similar as a kid: “You become  like your friends.” It is true not just with social influences but  informational ones too: If you are addicted to the chatter of the news,  you will soon find yourself worried, resentful, and perpetually  outraged. If you consume nothing but escapist entertainment, you will  find the real world around you harder and harder to deal with. If all  you do is watch the markets and obsess over every fluctuation, your  worldview will become defined by money and gains and losses. But if you  drink from deep, philosophical wisdom? If you have regularly in your  mind role models of restraint, sobriety, courage, and honor? Well, you  will start to become these things too. Tell me who you spend time with, Goethe said, and I will tell you who you are. Tell me what you pay attention to,  Gasset was saying, and I can tell you the same thing. Remember that the  next time you feel your finger itching to pull up your Facebook feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Better to trip with the feet than with the tongue.” — Zeno\nYou can always get up after you fall, but remember, what has been said can never be unsaid. Especially cruel and hurtful things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Space I can recover. Time, never.” — Napoleon Bonaparte\nLands can be reconquered, indeed in the course of a battle, a hill or a  certain plain might trade hands several times. But missed opportunities? These can never be regained. Moments in time, in culture? They can  never be re-made. One can never go back in time to prepare for what they should have prepared for, no one can ever get back critical seconds  that were wasted out of fear or ego. Napoleon was brilliant at trading space for time: Sure, you can make  these moves, provided you are giving me the time I need to drill my  troops, or move them to where I want them to be. Yet in life, most of us are terrible at this. We trade an hour of our life here or afternoon  there like it can be bought back with the few dollars we were paid for  it. And it is only much much later, as they are on their deathbeds or  when they are looking back on what might have been, that many people  realize the awful truth of this quote. Don’t do that. Embrace it now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“You never know who’s swimming naked until the tide goes out.” — Warren Buffett\nThe problem with comparing yourself to other people is you really never  know anyone else’s situation. The co-worker with a nice car? It could be a dangerous and unsafe salvage with 100,000 miles. The friend who  always seems to be traveling to far off places? They could be up to  their eyeballs in credit card debt and about to get fired by their boss. Your neighbors’ marriage which makes you so insecure about your own? It could be a nightmare, a complete lie. People do a very good job  pretending at things, and their well-maintained fronts are often covers  for incredible risk and irresponsibility. You never know, Warren Buffett was saying, until things get bad. If you’re living the life you know to be right, if you are making good, solid decisions, don’t be swayed by  what others are doing — whether that is taking the form of irrational  exuberance or panicked pessimism. See the high flying lives of others as a cautionary tale — like Icarus with his wings — and not as an  inspiration or a source of insecurity. Keep doing what you’re doing and  don’t be caught swimming naked! Because the tide will go out. Prepare  for it! (Premeditatio Malorum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Search others for their virtues, thyself for thy vices.” — Benjamin Franklin\nMarcus Aurelius would say something similar: “Be tolerant with others and strict with  yourself.” Why? For starters because the only person you control is  yourself. It’s a complete waste of time to go around projecting strict  standards on other people — ones they never agreed to follow in the  first place — and then being aghast or feel wronged when they fall  short. The other reason is you have no idea what other people are going  or have been through. That person who seemed to rudely decline the  invitation you so kindly offered? What if they were working hard to  recommit themselves to their family and as much as they’d like to have  coffee with you, are doing their best to spend more time with their  loved ones? The point is: You have no idea. So give people the benefit  of the doubt. Look for good in them, assume good in them, and let that  good inspire your own actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The world was not big enough for Alexander the Great, but a coffin was.” — Juvenal\nAh, the way that a good one liner can humble even the world’s greatest  conqueror. Remember: we are all equals in death. It makes quick work of  all of us, big and small. I carry a coin in my pocket to remember this: Memento Mori. What Juvenal reminds us is the same thing that Shakespeare spoke about in Hamlet:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.O’ that that earth which kept the world in aweShould patch a wall t’ expel the winder’s flaw!”\nIt doesn’t matter how famous you are, how powerful you are, how much you think you have left to do on this planet, the same thing happens to all of us, and it can happen when we least expect it. And then we will be  wormfood and that’s the end of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“To improve is to change, so to be perfect is to have changed often.” — Winston Churchill\nWhile this is probably not a Churchill original (he most likely borrowed from Cardinal Newman: “In a higher world it is otherwise, but here  below to live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed  often”), Churchill certainly abided this in his life. He’d even quip about his constant change of political affiliation: “I  said a lot of stupid things when I worked with the Conservative Party,  and I left it because I did not want to go on saying stupid things.” As  Cicero would say when attacked that he was changing his opinion: “If  something strikes me as probable, I say it; and that is how, unlike  everyone else, I remain a free agent.” There is  nothing more impressive — intellectually or otherwise — than to change  long held beliefs, opinions, and habits. The more you’ve changed, the  better you probably are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Judge not, lest you be judged.” — Jesus\nNot only here would Jesus call us on one of our worst tendencies but  immediately also ask: “And why do you look at the speck in your  brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?” This line is similar to what the Stoic philosopher Seneca, who historical sources suggest was born the same year as Jesus, would say: “You look at the pimples of others when you yourselves are  covered with a mass of sores.” Waste no time judging and worrying about  other people. You have plenty of problems to deal with in your own life. Chances are your own flaws are probably worse — and in any case, they  are at least in your control. So do something about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Time and patience are the strongest warriors.” — Leo Tolstoy\nTolstoy puts the above words in the mouth of Field Marshall Mikhail Kutuzov in War and Peace. In real life, Kutuzov gave Napoleon a painful lesson in the truth of  the epigram over a long winter in Russia in 1812. Tolstoy would also  say, “Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.” When it  comes to accomplishing anything significant, you are required to exhibit patience and fortitude, so much patience, as much as you’d think you’d need boldness and courage. In my book Conspiracy, about Peter Thiel’s plot to destroy Gawker, his operative describes a similar idea: With enough time and patience, you can do anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“No one saves us but ourselves &#x2F; No one can and no one may.” — Buddha\nWill we wait for someone to save us, or will we listen to Marcus Aurelius’s  empowering call to “get active in your own rescue — if you care for  yourself at all — and do it while you can.”\nBecause at some point, we must put articles like this one aside and take  action. No one can blow our nose for us. Another blog post isn’t the  answer. The right choices and decisions are. Who knows how much time you have left, or what awaits us tomorrow? So get to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike to Read?\nRight away.\n说明参考文档：https://medium.com/thrive-global/21-quotes-that-if-applied-change-boys-into-men-3e124aff36f8.\n","slug":"21-Quotes-That-(If-Applied)-Change-You-Into-a-Better-Person","date":"2022-04-26T07:35:47.000Z","categories_index":"medium","tags_index":"blog,quote","author_index":"Everett327"},{"id":"767c5a6081890e0a1eadeb463922b49b","title":"15 Books Everyone Should Read At Least Once","content":"Have you ever tried to pick your next read and felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices?\nWith approximately 130 million books in the world and more and more coming  out every day, it is increasingly difficult to decide what to read next. While some people read habitually and for pleasure, there are others  who might not be inclined so and want to read for its benefits, or to  inculcate reading habit, and not know where to start.\nAs an avid reader since childhood, here are my picks for TOP 15 books that you MUST read — even if you are not into reading.\nThe list is in increasing order of difficulty, based on the topic, language and length, and is a fair mix of fiction and non-fiction.\n1. Animal Farm by George OrwellAnimal Farm is a deceptively simple story of pigs, goats, sheep, cows,  puppies, hens and humans, a fairy tale of sorts. This novella is a poignant comment on the cycle of society, where an oppressor is overthrown only  to be replaced by another oppressor. According to Orwell, the fable  reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.\n2. Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch AlbomAnother simple and beautiful read throwing light on love, life, loss and death. Tuesdays With Morrie presents a valuable reminder that “once you learn to die, you learn to live”. Filled with innumerable gems of  wisdom, this is must-read for people of all ages.\n3. To Kill A Mocking Bird by Harper LeeA classic of modern American literature, this Pulitzer Prize winning  novel is painfully innocent and refreshingly honest. Set in the small  Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, To Kill A Mocking Bird presents the  views of a child on race and justice.\n4. The Hate U Give by Angie ThomasThe quintessential Black Lives Matter book, The Hate U Give by Angie  Thomas sheds light on the reality of how the society systematically  represses a race.

Wild: Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail by Cheryl StrayedRaw, emotional and brutally honest account of loss and grief, spiraling  down and finding oneself through travel, Wild by Cheryl Strayed is a  highly enjoyable and enlightening read.\n7. Pride and Prejudice by Jane AustenPride and Prejudice is a well-renowned historical romance, a classic,  but it is so much more than that!

It can feel impossible to move toward your dreams. If you have a full-time job and kids, it’s even harder.\nHow do you move forward?\nIf you don’t purposefully carve time out every day to progress and  improve — without question, your time will get lost in the vacuum of our increasingly crowded lives. Before you know it, you’ll be old and  withered — wondering where all that time went.\nAs Professor Harold Hill has said — “You pile up enough tomorrows, and you’ll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.”\nRethinking Your Life and Getting Out of Survival ModeThis article is intended to challenge you to rethink your entire  approach to life. The purpose is to help you simplify and get back to  the fundamentals.\nSadly, most people’s lives are filled to the brim with the nonessential  and trivial. They don’t have time to build toward anything meaningful.\nThey are in survival mode. Are you in survival mode?\nLike Bilbo, most of us are like butter scraped over too much bread.  Unfortunately, the bread is not even our own, but someone else’s. Very  few have taken the time to take their lives into their own hands.\nIt was social and cultural to live our lives on other people’s terms just  one generation ago. And many millennials are perpetuating this process  simply because it’s the only worldview we’ve been taught.\nHowever, there is a growing collective-consciousness that with a lot of work and intention — you can live every moment of your life on your own terms.\nYou are the designer of your destiny.\nYou are responsible.\nYou get to decide. You must decide — because if you don’t, someone else will. Indecision is a bad decision.\nWith this short morning routine, your life will quickly change.\nIt may seem like a long list. But in short, it’s really quite simple:\n\nWake up\nGet in the zone\nGet moving\nPut the right food in your body\nGet ready\nGet inspired\nGet perspective\nDo something to move you forward\n\n1. Get A Healthy 7+ Hours of SleepLet’s face it — Sleep is just as important as eating and drinking water.  Despite this, millions of people do not sleep enough and experience  insane problems as a result.\nThe National Sleep Foundation (NSF) conducted surveys revealing that at  least 40 million Americans suffer from over 70 different sleep  disorders. Not only that, 60 percent of adults, and 69 percent of  children, experience one or more sleep problems a few nights or more  during a week.\nIn addition, more than 40 percent of adults experience daytime sleepiness  severe enough to interfere with their daily activities at least a few  days each month — with 20 percent reporting problem sleepiness a few  days a week or more.\nOn the flip side, getting a healthy amount of sleep is linked to:\n\nIncreased memory\nLonger life\nDecreased inflammation\nIncreased creativity\nIncreased attention and focus\nDecreased fat and increased muscle mass with exercise\nLower stress\nDecreased dependence on stimulants like caffeine\nDecreased risk of getting into accidents\nDecreased risk of depression\nAnd tons more… google it.\n\nThe rest of this blog post is worthless if you don’t make sleep a priority. Who cares if you wake up at 5 o’clock A.M. if you went to bed three  hours earlier?\nYou won’t last long.\nYou may use stimulants to compensate, but that isn’t sustainable. In the  long-run, your health will fall apart. The goal needs to be long-term  sustainability.\n2. Prayer and Meditation to Facilitate Clarity and AbundanceAfter waking from a healthy and restful sleep session, prayer and meditation  are crucial for orienting yourself toward the positive. What you focus  on expands.\nPrayer and meditation facilitate intense gratitude for all that you have.  Gratitude is having an abundance mindset. When you think abundantly, the world is your oyster. There is limitless opportunity and possibility  for you.\nPeople are magnets. When you’re grateful for what you have, you will attract  more of the positive and good. Gratitude is contagious.\nGratitude may be the most important key to success. It has been called the mother of all virtues.\nIf you start every morning putting yourself in a space of gratitude and  clarity, you will attract the best the world has to offer, and not get  distracted.\n3. Hard Physical ActivityDespite endless evidence of the need for exercise, only one-third of American  men and women between the ages of 25 to 64 years engage in regular  physical activity according to the Center for Disease Control’s National Health Interview Survey.\nIf you want to be among the healthy, happy, and productive people in the  world, get in the habit of regular exercise. Many people go immediately  to the gym to get their body moving. I have lately found that doing yard work in the wee hours of the morning generates an intense inflow of  inspiration and clarity.\nWhatever your preference, get your body moving.\nExercise has been found to decrease your chance of depression, anxiety, and  stress. It is also related to higher success in your career.\nIf you don’t care about your body, every other aspect of your life will suffer. Humans are holistic beings\n4. Consume 30 Grams of ProteinDonald Layman, professor emeritus of nutrition at the University of Illinois,  recommends consuming at least 30 grams of protein for breakfast.  Similarly, Tim Ferriss, in his book, The 4-Hour Body, also recommends 30 grams of protein 30 minutes after waking up.\nAccording to Tim, his father did this and lost 19 pounds in one month.\nProtein-rich foods keep you full longer than other foods because they take longer to leave the stomach. Also, protein keeps blood-sugar levels steady, which prevents spikes in hunger.\nEating protein first decreases your white carbohydrate cravings. These are the types of carbs that get you fat. Think bagels, toast, and donuts.\nTim makes four recommendations for getting adequate protein in the morning:\n\nEat at least 40% of your breakfast calories as protein\nDo it with two or three whole eggs (each egg has about 6g protein)\nIf you don’t like eggs, use something like turkey bacon, organic pork bacon or sausage, or cottage cheese\nOr, you could always do a protein shake with water\n\nFor people who avoid dairy, meat, and eggs, there are several plant-based  proteins. Legumes, greens, nuts, and seeds all are rich in protein.\n5. Take A Cold ShowerTony Robbins starts every morning by jumping into a 57-degree Fahrenheit swimming pool.\nWhy would he do such a thing?\nCold water immersion radically facilitates physical and mental wellness.When practiced regularly, it provides long-lasting changes to your body’s  immune, lymphatic, circulatory and digestive systems that improve the  quality of your life. It can also increase weight-loss because it boosts your metabolism.\nA 2007 research study found that taking cold showers routinely can help treat depression  symptoms often more effectively than prescription medications. That’s  because cold water triggers a wave of mood-boosting neurochemicals which make you feel happy.\nThere is of course, an initial fear of stepping into a cold shower. Without a doubt, if you’ve tried this before, you have found yourself standing  outside the shower dreading the thought of going in.\nYou may have even talked yourself out of it and said, “Maybe tomorrow.” And turned the hot water handle before getting in.\nOr, maybe you jumped in but quickly turned the hot water on?\nWhat has helped me is thinking about it like a swimming pool. It’s a slow  painful death to get into a cold pool slowly. You just need to jump in.  After 20 seconds, you’re fine.\nIt’s the same way with taking a cold shower. You get in, you heart starts  beating like crazy. Then, after like 20 seconds, you feel fine.\nTo me, it increases my willpower and boosts my creativity and inspiration. While standing with the cold water hitting my back, I practice slowing  my breathing and calming down. After I’ve chilled out, I feel super  happy and inspired. Lots of ideas start flowing and I become way  motivated to achieve my goals.\nPlus, it’s healthy to do something in the morning that kind of freaks you  out! Get’s you feeling alive and sets the tone for living outside your  comfort zone!\n6. Listen to&#x2F;Read Uplifting ContentOrdinary people seek entertainment. Extraordinary people seek education and  learning. It is common for the world’s most successful people to read at least one book per week. They are constantly learning.\nI can easily get through one audiobook per week by just listening during my commute to school and while walking on campus.\nTaking even 15–30 minutes every morning to read uplifting and instructive  information changes you. It puts you in the zone to perform at your  highest.\nOver a long enough period of time, you will have read hundreds of books.  You’ll be knowledgeable on several topics. You’ll think and see the  world differently. You’ll be able to make more connections between  different topics.\n7. Review Your Life VisionYour goals should be written down — short term and long term. Taking just a  few minutes to read your life vision puts your day into perspective.\nIf you read your long term goals every day you will think about them every day. If you think about them every day, and spend your days working  toward them, they’ll manifest.\nAchieving goals is a science. There’s no confusion or ambiguity to it. If you  follow a simple pattern, you can accomplish all of your goals, no matter how big they are.\nA fundamental aspect of that is writing them down and reviewing them every single day.\n8. Do At Least One Thing Towards Long-Term GoalsWillpower is like a muscle that depletes when it is exercised. Similarly, our  ability to make high quality decisions becomes fatigued over time. The  more decisions you make, the lower quality they become — the weaker your willpower.\nConsequently, you need to do the hard stuff first thing in the morning. The important stuff.\nIf you don’t, it simply will not get done. By the end of your day, you’ll  be exhausted. You’ll be fried. There will be a million reasons to just  start tomorrow. And you will start tomorrow — which is never.\nSo your mantra becomes: The worst comes first. Do that thing you’ve been needing to do. Then do it again tomorrow.\nIf you take just one step toward you big goals every day, you’ll realize those goals weren’t really far away.\nConclusionAfter you’ve done this, no matter what you have for the rest of your day,  you’ll have done the important stuff first. You’ll have put yourself in a place to succeed. You’ll have inched toward your dreams.\nBecause you’ll have done all these things, you’ll show up better in life.  You’ll be better at your job. You’ll be better in your relationships.  You’ll be happier. You’ll be more confident. You’ll be more bold and  daring. You’ll have more clarity and vision.\nYour life will shortly change.\nYou can’t have mornings like this consistently without waking up to all  that is incongruent in your life. Those things you despise will meet  their demise. They’ll disappear and never return.\nYou’ll quickly find you’re doing the work you’re passionate about.\nYour relationships will be passionate, meaningful, deep, and fun!\nYou will have freedom and abundance.\nThe world, and the universe, will respond to you in beautiful ways.\n说明参考文章：8 Things Every Person Should Do Before 8 A.M..\n","slug":"8-Things-Every-Person-Should-Do-Before-8-A.M.","date":"2022-04-23T07:11:43.000Z","categories_index":"medium","tags_index":"blog","author_index":"Everett327"},{"id":"b4677960325826072ee57aa5ab443455","title":"10 Dostoevsky Quotes For Deep Thinkers","content":"Here I have compiled a list of 10 thoughts that will navigate you through your dive deep into the human consciousness. (Don’t forget to come back for comment though!)\n10. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery.This was true when there were powerful political kings in the world, and it is true today with our powerful corporate princesses.\nWhen we are going after something in full intensity and desire, those  speed bumps are annoying which halt us to remind us — what we’re  pursuing is perverse. For a person who wants things from us, it is  surely healthier to tell us how well we drive than show us what we’ve  ignored!\n9. Lack of originality, everywhere, all over the world, from time immemorial,  has always been considered the foremost quality and the recommendation  of the active, efficient and practical man…To be original, you have to see deep.\nTo see deep, you have to go slow.\nIf you are slow, the world will seem faster.\nThe world seems faster because it moves faster.\nIt moves faster because it isn’t concerned about originality. It merely wants to ‘make-it’\nThe ones who ‘make-it’ fast are active, efficient, and practical!\n8. A fool with a heart and no sense is just as unhappy as a fool with sense and no heart.A person who is at all times deeply immersed in feelings doesn’t have control over things.\nA person who is at all times in control of things, doesn’t have time for feelings.\nBoth are fools and unhappy!\n7. Inventors and geniuses have almost always been looked on as no better than fools  at the beginning of their career, and very frequently at the end of it  also.True inventors and geniuses are original thinkers. And:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be original, you have to see deep.\nTo see deep, you have to go slow.\n(Just as in Quote No9)\nIt’s apparent that if you see deeper than others, you will be called a fool, for they cannot even imagine what you are able to see.\nIt’s also apparent that if go slower than others, you will be called a fool. For others have started running while you are still crawling in  your diapers.\nBUT,\nWhat about the end?\nDID you get it? Please give your perspective in the Comments.\n6. Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness to  yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute.It’s hard to listen to adverse things about ourselves. It’s almost impossible to admit them!\nIt’s easy to say adverse things about others. It’s almost easiest to consider it to be true.\nFirst, stop lying to yourself. Stop lying to  yourself that this Dostoevsky quote compilation you are doing on Medium  is not for views, reads, email subscribers and money.\nTell yourself loud and clear: I also need money in life. I need it  through my writing. Don’t hide behind fancy make-believes. Admit the  truth to yourself. Don’t live in delusion.\nLook at yourself on your front camera each night: Count how many people  you deceived that day. Look at yourself in your front camera each  morning: Say you will try to decrease at least one deception this day.\n5. In most cases, people, even the most vicious, are much more naive and  simple-minded than we assume them to be. And this is true of ourselves too.This is where Dostoevsky’s genius truly shines.\nIn moments of both excitement and disappointment, we tend to exaggerate a lot. When our personal heroes manage to satisfy our demands, we run out of positive adjectives to describe them. When  someone becomes an opposite force pushing us further from where we  desired to be, we run out of derogatory adjectives to describe that  person.\nAnd the same applies to our self-judgment. We, humans, are simple if we  understand the basics. There are a few laws. We need to understand them.\n4. To be in love is not the same as loving. You can be in love with a woman and still hate her.Being in love is a feeling while loving is a temporary attitude. The  former is romantic in nature while the latter could mean sympathy, pity, and even awe.\nThe opposite of being in love is loathe. The opposite of loving is hating.\nYou can be in love with a person, and still hate that person’s behavior, character, and actions.\n3. Above all, do not lie to yourself. A man who lies to himself and listens to  his own lie comes to a point where he does not discern any truth either  in himself or anywhere around him, and thus falls into disrespect  towards himself and others.If you lie so much that you begin lying to yourself too, you become a  chronic-liar. It will lead to you losing both the ability and the will  to look at things truly.\nYou will start deceiving yourself. All you will try to do is convince  yourself and others that your point-of-view is the only truth and the  only real way of looking at things. That is, you lie and falsify everything to both advance and defend your perspective and actions. You will not only spit lies but also swallow them.\nAnd what will all this lead to?\nYou lose the respect of others and therefore of yourself.\nYou lose the respect of others because they can see through you. They  can see that you are unoriginal, unworthy and self-deceiving. And hence, they decode your game. It doesn’t matter to them if they are the same.  We all like to spit on others, remember?\nAnd once we perceive ourselves being disrespected by others — it’s impossible for us to respect ourselves.\n2. For there are two sorts of mind: one that matters, and one that doesn’t matter.One type of mind is that — which understands and pursues things of value and truth. The other type of mind doesn’t care about that stuff. It  pursues things of advantage.\nWe all have these two categories of minds within us. We have both the  impulse to pursue value and truth, and also things of advantage.\nThe mind which pursues truth is the one that matters. The other doesn’t!\n1. Talking nonsense is man’s only privilege that distinguishes him from all other organisms.说明参考文章：10 Dostoevsky Quotes For Deep Thinkers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n今天是世界图书日。(the world book day)\n","slug":"10-Dostoevsky-Quotes-For-Deep-Thinkers","date":"2022-04-23T06:45:36.000Z","categories_index":"medium","tags_index":"blog,quote","author_index":"Everett327"},{"id":"b9663f58f18133b35bfe243f3e916a80","title":"Hello World","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
